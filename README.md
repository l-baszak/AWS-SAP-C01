### Description

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ It's a repository for the personal use. It's designed to help me in preparation for the **AWS-SAP-C01** exam. Labs and theory pages are not complete tutorials and won't be enough to pass the exam, so bare that in mind. I hope it will cover mainly more likee nuances occurring on the exam and more advanced topics. I hope You will find something useful in here. All **labs** will be written either in **Golang** or as a **Bash** script. All **theory** lessons will be in the Markdown format. **Good luck passing the exam!**
